This circuit is based on the LM2596-ADJ reference application, implemented on a 2-layer PCB optimized for power integrity. The core regulator chip is the LM2596T-ADJ. The TO-220 package was chosen specifically because it is easy to hand-solder for prototyping and allows for good thermal management via external heatsinking, which is good for a 3A power circuit. Output regulation is fixed at 5v DC, set by the ratio of the feedback resistors (r1 and r2), with R1 set at 1k to minimize noise on the feedback pin. the main switching elements include a 68 uH inductor (l1), rated for over 3A to prevent saturation, and a 1N5825 schottky diode (cr1), selected for its fast switching speed and low losses. Protection features include a 3.5A slow-blow fuse (f1) to handle initial capacitor current and a 1N4001 diode (d1) providing reverse-polarity protection by shorting the input to blow the fuse upon fault. A led indicator circuit (d2/r3) confirms output voltage presence.

The physical layout is minimized to the area of the high-current switching loop (u1, c1, cr1, l1, and c3), which are tightly packed in the center to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI). The bottom copper layer is entirely dedicated to a solid ground plane to provide a low-impedance current return path for stability. All traces carrying power were intentionally maximized to 1mm (50 mils) to easily handle the required 1A load and minimize voltage drop across the board.
